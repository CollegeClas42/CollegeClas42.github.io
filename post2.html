    <h2>Workday’s New AI “Recruiting Agent” Is Basically HR Automation on Steroids</h2>
    <p class="post-date-page">January 22, 2026</p>

    <p>
      Workday announced new AI agents on September 17, 2024, and one of the biggest ones is a Recruiting Agent.
      Instead of AI just answering questions, Workday is aiming for AI that helps do real hiring work—like drafting
      job descriptions, supporting candidate sourcing, helping with scheduling, and summarizing applicant info.
    </p>

    <p>
      This matters because recruiting teams get overloaded fast. If you’re filling multiple roles at once, the small stuff
      piles up: emails, calendar invites, job post edits, screening notes, and more. AI agents are being built to handle the
      boring parts so recruiters can focus on interviews and actual decision-making.
    </p>

    <p>
      My take: this is the kind of AI companies will buy because it saves time immediately. But I’m watching for the downside:
      if recruiters rely too much on AI summaries, you could get lazy hiring where people don’t actually read resumes or evaluate
      candidates fairly. AI should speed up the process, not lower the quality of it.
