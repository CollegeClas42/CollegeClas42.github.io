    <h2>Topic Focus</h2>
    <p>
      My newsletter covers applied AI tools in hiring and HR—especially how recruiters and job seekers use AI
      to screen candidates, write outreach, and speed up hiring workflows.
    </p>

    <h2>Why I Chose This Topic</h2>
    <p>
      I chose this focus because hiring is one of the fastest areas adopting AI. These tools can save time and
      reduce repetitive work, but they also raise real issues around fairness, transparency, and whether the process
      starts feeling too automated. I want to track both the benefits and the risks as AI becomes normal in recruiting.
