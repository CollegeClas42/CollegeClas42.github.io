    <h2>How AI Is Shaping Hiring and HR Workflows</h2>
    <p class="post-date-page">February 1, 2026</p>

    <p>
      AI is becoming deeply embedded in modern hiring and HR workflows. From resume screening to recruiter
      outreach and candidate tracking, companies are using AI tools to move faster and handle large volumes
      of applicants more efficiently.

    <p>
      In recruiting, AI often supports early-stage tasks like reviewing resumes, ranking applicants, and
      identifying potential matches. These tools can save recruiters time, but they also raise concerns
      about transparency and over-automation.

    <p>
      This type of automation shows how AI systems can process information quickly, but it also highlights
      why oversight matters. If recruiters rely too heavily on AI summaries or recommendations, important
      context about candidates can be lost.

    <p>
      My takeaway is that AI should support hiring decisions, not replace human judgment. The most effective
      hiring systems will balance automation with accountability, ensuring that people—not algorithms—remain
      responsible for final decisions.
