    <h2>Why AI Still Needs Human Oversight in Hiring Decisions</h2>
    <p class="post-date-page">February 1, 2026</p>

    <p>
      AI tools are becoming a normal part of the hiring process, especially for screening
      resumes, ranking candidates, and summarizing applicant data. These systems can save
      time and reduce repetitive work for recruiters, but they also introduce new risks
      when used without proper oversight.
    </p>

    <p>
      One major concern is that AI systems often learn from historical hiring data. If past
      hiring decisions were biased or inconsistent, AI can unintentionally reinforce those
      same patterns. This can result in qualified candidates being filtered out before a
      human ever reviews their application.
    </p>

    <p>
      Another issue is overreliance. When recruiters trust AI-generated summaries too much,
      they may stop reading resumes closely or questioning automated recommendations.
      This can turn AI from a support tool into a silent decision-maker.
    </p>

    <p>
      My takeaway is that AI works best when it supports—not replaces—human judgment.
      Recruiters and HR teams should treat AI outputs as suggestions, not final answers.
      Human accountability is still essential for fair, ethical, and effective hiring.
