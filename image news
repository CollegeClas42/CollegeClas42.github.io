    <h2>How Recruiters Are Using AI Images in Hiring</h2>
    <p class="post-date-page">January 31, 2026</p>

    <p>
      AI-generated images are starting to appear in hiring and HR workflows, especially in job postings,
      employer branding, and recruitment marketing. Instead of paying for custom photoshoots or stock images,
      companies can generate visuals that match their roles and culture instantly.

    <p>
      These images are often used on career pages, LinkedIn job posts, and recruiting ads. While this can save
      time and money, it also raises questions about authenticity and whether candidates feel misled by
      overly polished AI visuals.

    <p>
      My take: AI-generated images are fine as long as they’re used honestly. They should support recruiting,
      not fake a company culture that doesn’t exist. Like other hiring AI tools, transparency matters.
