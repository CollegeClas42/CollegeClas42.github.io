    <h2>LinkedIn Is Using AI to Help Recruiters Message People Faster</h2>
    <p class="post-date-page">January 20, 2026</p>

    <p>
      LinkedIn has been adding more AI features into LinkedIn Recruiter, and it’s starting to change how recruiters
      reach out to people. In their 2024 Recruiter product releases, LinkedIn rolled out tools like AI-assisted messaging,
      where the system helps draft outreach messages so recruiters aren’t typing everything from scratch.
    </p>

    <p>
      Recruiters can still edit the message, but AI gives them a “good enough” starting point in seconds. This matters
      because recruiting is basically a nonstop loop: searching for candidates, sending messages, and following up. AI can
      speed that up, which sounds great—but it also means candidates might get even more messages that feel copy-and-paste,
      just with their name dropped in.
    </p>

    <p>
      My take: this kind of AI use makes sense. Recruiters shouldn’t spend half their day writing the same message 40 times.
      But if everyone uses AI for outreach, the hiring process could start feeling even more robotic. The best recruiters will
      still stand out by sounding like real people and actually understanding what they’re hiring for.
